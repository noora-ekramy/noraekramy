                  The future of AI isn't about robots taking over‚Äîit's about AI becoming invisible. 
                  We're moving toward a world where AI is so seamlessly integrated into our tools and 
                  workflows that we stop thinking about it as "AI" and simply experience it as enhanced

                  <p className="text-gray-300">
                    Imagine AI that anticipates your needs, adapts to your working style, and augments 
                    your capabilities without requiring explicit commands. This ambient intelligence 
                    will transform how we work, learn, and create.
